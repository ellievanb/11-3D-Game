# 11-3D-Game

For my 3D Game, I created an obstacle course for a first-person persepctive character to cross. The goal is to collect all 24 coins and make it to the finish line without falling off the map. To play, use WASD to move and the spacebar to jump. Press escape to make the mouse reappear, and left-click on the mouse to make it disappear again.

I faced some big issues making this game. The biggest for me was that while we learned how to have lives in our 2D paddle game, I could not figure out how to make the character to lose a life whenever they fall off the map in this game.
